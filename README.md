<h1>Yet Another Multiplayer FPS</h1>

That's right, I've done it again!
Your favourite Unity Developer has started another FPS Project, but this one is ***better.***

## Features so far :D
### Movement
Currently, the character controller is pretty damn cool. Its taken me a few days to get these features in.
You can currently walk, sprint and crouch. You can aim and "side aim" (pending a change to be called "alternate aim")


Gonna move this over to a Github Pages thing perhaps?
